Hello,

My name is Gabe - I currently reside in Richmond, VA and have extensive experience (10+ years) working in practically applied sysadmin/engineer/SRE roles.
I've most recently worked at MaxMind and Discourse which are both fully remote companies - with Discourse also being globally distributed.

I enjoy working with people and troubleshooting problems, while creating and iterating on the stack and learning new skills and tricks-of-the-trade.

Originally a Linux SysAdmin I still get a lot of enjoyment out of operating generalized "systems" neatly and efficiently.
I'm familiar with operating at a higher-level platform engineering and or at smaller scale web services administration.

I'm familiar operating in secured financially sensitive environments, for example managing the infrastructure for minFraud at MaxMind.
Understand system hardening procedures and undergoing audits and working directly with auditors for ie. SOC2 certifications.

I'm comfortable creating and maintaining internal tooling around infrastructure and working with all teammates to help them better iterate in their own roles.
Familiar with various low to high-level languages, ie. from C to Python to go and rust.

I have experience managing all types of infrastructure, from baremetal to GCP and AWS environments managed via terraform as IaaC.
Familiar with managing and monitoring physical or virtual network devices, ie. firewalls and load balancers.

I think my experience is in line with this posting and I'd be very interested in learning more about this position!
Thanks for your consideration!
